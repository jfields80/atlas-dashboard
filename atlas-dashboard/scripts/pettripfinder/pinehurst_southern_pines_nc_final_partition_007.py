"""PTF-PINEHURST-SOUTHERN-PINES-NC-PARALLEL-SOURCE-READY-001 -- the final partition.

Every census Pinehurst - Southern Pines identity, in EXACTLY ONE state, with exactly one next
action for every state that is not terminal. This is the disposition authority
the sealed package reconciles the census against: a census identity with no
partition row, or two, is a refusal to seal.

THE STATES THIS MARKET USES, AND WHY
------------------------------------
  PUBLISHED_PET_FRIENDLY      an operative acceptance on the property's own
                              page, bound to its own street identity, hashed.
  VERIFIED_NO_PETS            an operative refusal, same standard.
  ACCESS_BLOCKED              the surface refused to serve us. Choice (a
                              sitemap timeout and an attended bot-challenge
                              shell) refused this client on this run.
                              This records the FETCH OUTCOME only: a refusal
                              proves nothing about the property.
  AWAITING_POLICY_OBSERVATION the route is sound, the page served, and no pet
                              policy has ever been observed on it. UNKNOWN, and
                              never a refusal. A service-animal-only statement
                              and a property whose own pages CONFLICT are here
                              too: neither is a refusal and neither publishes.
  AWAITING_OFFICIAL_URL       no first-party source in this order stated a route
                              for this identity at all.
  AWAITING_IDENTITY_RESOLUTION the identity itself is provisional: a dual-brand
                              address this order could not prove distinct, or a
                              rebrand whose current flag is not settled.

Nothing here publishes and nothing here is a founder decision.
