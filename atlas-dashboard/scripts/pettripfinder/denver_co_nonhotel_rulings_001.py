"""PTF-DENVER-CO-HARDENED-SOURCE-READY-001 -- the vacation-rental / timeshare / resort-residence / venue filter.

Two mechanisms, both refusal DECISIONS with their reasons:

1. ``NOT_LODGING_WHY`` / ``LODGING_UNCONFIRMED`` -- matched on the full normalised name
   (``site_data.normalize_name``) of a census candidate, added only after that row's evidence was read.
2. ``nonhotel_by_name`` -- the order's Phase 5 rule applied to a row's OWN name: a vacation-home community, a
   villa / condo / townhome rental, a resort-residence club or a vacation-ownership (timeshare) resort is refused
   UNLESS a brand's own public hotel inventory or a hotel page read reached the row. When the operator itself lists
   those exact premises as a bookable hotel with its own property page, the row is judged on that page instead --
   that is the "prove exact public hotel operation" test, and a name alone never passes or fails it.

The reason string always starts with the exclusion class (VACATION_RENTAL / TIMESHARE / RESORT_RESIDENCE / NON_HOTEL)
so the accounting counts each class without re-deriving it.

Nothing here fetches and nothing here admits.

#: MEASURED IN THIS ORDER: the committed nonhotel-rulings modules this file was cloned from (Jacksonville, Miami,
#: Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach) carry literal BACKSPACE bytes (0x08) where this pattern's two ``\b`` word
#: boundaries belong -- a heredoc that wrote ``\b`` into a non-raw string -- so in those markets this rule could
#: never match anything. It was repaired in San Diego's own copy and is kept repaired here, and recorded as a finding; the other
#: markets' modules are not touched by this order (a cross-market change).
#: An ORDINARY APARTMENT COMMUNITY. The Fort Lauderdale build found that South Florida's vintage beachfront
#: motels are licensed MOTL and named "... Apartment Motel" / "... Apartment Hotel"; the Philips Highway and
#: University Boulevard motor-court row in 32216 -- 18 hotel-rank licences, this market's oldest -- and the
#: Commonwealth Avenue row on the Westside carry the same vocabulary.
