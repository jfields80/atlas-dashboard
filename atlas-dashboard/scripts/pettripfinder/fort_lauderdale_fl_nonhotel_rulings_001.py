"""PTF-FORT-LAUDERDALE-FL-HARDENED-SOURCE-READY-001 -- the vacation-rental / timeshare / resort-residence / venue filter.

Two mechanisms, both refusal DECISIONS with their reasons:

1. ``NOT_LODGING_WHY`` / ``LODGING_UNCONFIRMED`` -- matched on the full normalised name
   (``site_data.normalize_name``) of a census candidate, added only after that row's evidence was read.
2. ``nonhotel_by_name`` -- the order's Phase 5 rule applied to a row's OWN name: a vacation-home community, a
   villa / condo / townhome rental, a resort-residence club or a vacation-ownership (timeshare) resort is refused
   UNLESS a brand's own public hotel inventory or a hotel page read reached the row. When the operator itself lists
   those exact premises as a bookable hotel with its own property page, the row is judged on that page instead --
   that is the "prove exact public hotel operation" test, and a name alone never passes or fails it.

The reason string always starts with the exclusion class (VACATION_RENTAL / TIMESHARE / RESORT_RESIDENCE / NON_HOTEL)
so the accounting counts each class without re-deriving it.

Nothing here fetches and nothing here admits.
